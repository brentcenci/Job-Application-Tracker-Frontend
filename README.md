# Job Application ReactJS Dashboard
<hr>

## Overview 📝📌

This is the site dashboard to interact with and view job applications for my Job Application Tracker project, which works in conjunction with the Kotlin / Ktor backend with a MongoDB database (see www.github.com/brentcenci/placeholder).

The site includes the following features:
- Light and Dark modes
- User authentication (login, register, logout)
- Grid overview of important statistics
- An interactive data grid table showcasing all applications
- Add new applications with a modal field
- Live-edit existing applications within the table
- Delete applications via the table

## Technologies 💻
It is built using Vite, React, and Tailwind, with Axios for network connection requests to my backend API.

For visual data viewing, I used AgCharts for their simple and adaptive features.

For the table component, I used AgDataGrid for React, as this gave me more design freedom than other libraries without too much fussing about building entirely custom components - while still giving me functions to sort, filter and live-edit fields almost entirely out-of-the-box.
